## Layout Notes

We'll need the following page views:

- Home / Browse
- Profile
- Read
- Library
- Write
- About
- Donate

Note - due to the unecessary complexity of storing state globally across page navigations, we will opt for the standard SPA approach. This is a web app that is meant to be easily and quickly navigated once loaded in the browser - the initial load time is less important than quick and easy navigation once using the app.
